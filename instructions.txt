Modify the template compliment.html to ask the person if they’d like to play a game (hint: try radio buttons). Have this form submit to the URL path /game. This form won’t work until we make the endpoint on flask, so now…

Make a function called show_madlib_form() and have the URL /game route to it. In this function, get the user’s response to the yes-or-no question on the “would you like to play a game?” form.
