## YOUR TASK ##
(copied from lab instructions)

Now that we’ve got a solid foundation for our first webapp, let’s have some fun.

1.  Modify the template compliment.html to ask the person if they’d like to play a game (hint: try radio buttons). Have this form submit to the URL path /game. This form won’t work until we make the endpoint on flask, so now…

2.  Make a function called show_madlib_form() and have the URL /game route to it. In this function, get the user’s response to the yes-or-no question on the “would you like to play a game?” form.

    If they said no, return a rendered template, goodbye.html, that tells them goodbye and that they’ll be missed (or something else appropriate).

    If they said yes, render a different template, game.html. The template game.html should have a simple form that asks for a person, a color, a noun, and an adjective. How you choose to implement those inputs is up to you, but you should feel free to mix and match. (Hint: it might be fun to try one as a drop-down menu of choices). This new form should have the action of /madlib.

3.  Write a new function, show_madlib(), which is routed to by the URL path /madlib. It should render the template madlib.html, which should fill the person, color, noun, and adjective provided by the user into a MadLibs-style story.


## EXAMPLE ##
<form>
  Choose a shipping method:

  <input type="radio" name="shipping" value="standard">
  <label>Standard shipping (5-7 days)</label>

  <input type="radio" name="shipping" value="expedited">
  <label>Expedited shipping (1-3 days)</label>
</form>
